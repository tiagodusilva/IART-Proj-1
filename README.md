# IART-Proj-1

## Instructions

### Without visualization

Install pypy3 and run the following command from the root directory:
```
pypy3 main.py 
```
You can also use Python, however, the program will run considerably slower. PyPy does not support numpy and matplotlib, so please do not use the `-v` flag.

### With visualization

Install Python 3.8 or above and install the `numpy` and `matplotlib` packages using the following command:
```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
In Windows, there may be some problems depending on if Python was installed for all users or not. In that case, running this command from a command prompt with administrative privileges should fix it.

After installing the required modules please run the following command (the flag `-v` enables the visualization):
```
python main.py -v
```
